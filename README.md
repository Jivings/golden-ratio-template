Golden Ratio Template
=====================

A responsive template based around the [Golden Ratio][1] to improve reading and overall user experience.

Inspired by [Sven Read][2], each height, width, padding and margin is defined by the golden ratio. The base font is 16px, changing in increments with screen size.
